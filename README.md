# 10-Second-Party-Game

   The title for my game is Coin Craze, a short platformer game. In this game you play as the main character, Randy, in which you must go through a series of platforming jumps in order to collect all 5 coins scattered throughout the map before the 10 second timer at the top of the screen runs out. In terms of mechanics, the player can move left and right using the A and D keys on the keyboard, as well as jump with the SPACE key. If you lightly tap SPACE, the player will jump lower than if you were to hold down the SPACE key. You can respawn if you fall into the pit of fire below, although, you might not have enough time to collect all coins within the 10 second time limit if you keep falling. 

Basic Requirements: 
-	My game is a single player 2D game made in Unity. It can be played with a keyboard and does not require a mouse or touchpad. The gameplay does not last more than 10 seconds. There is a 2 second text introduction at the beginning of the game informing the player with the basic controls and a short sentence quickly explaining the objective. The game has a clear goal and win/loss state (if player collects 5 coins in under 10 seconds, they win. If not and timer runs out, they lose). My game has a 2 second endgame state where if the player collects all coins it says, “You win!” and if they lose it says, “You lose!” I also did not clone a basic Unity tutorial.

Audio Requirements:
-	The game has background music that kicks in only when the 10 seconds of gameplay starts and stops when the 10 seconds end. The 2 second announcement has a sound effect and the endgame states both have a win and lose sound effect. I added a sound effect for when the player picks up each coin for the significant sound effect requirement.

Visual Requirements
-	My game has a background and I custom created my player sprite using LibreSprite. I used a pixel fire particle effect that I created on Unity (fire image I obtained from Adobe Stock though). My game also has UI elements such as the functional text countdown timer that turns red when it hits zero, as well as a coin counter that updated when a player picks up each coin.
